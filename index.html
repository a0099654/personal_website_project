<p>I am a programmer wanna be who just graduated from National University of Singapore
  Having a big dream to influence people in a good way through entertainment technology
  such as games and animation resulted in my decision to pursue my studies in Singapore.
</p>

<p> I have been exposed to various modules in android application, web development, games, animation, film, among others.
  I've taken two games development module in NUS where my team has to develop an android game within 9 weeks.
  We uploaded our android game to google play.
  Here is the link to our game page

</p>

<p>
  My studies and work experiences have allowed me to meet different people from the industry.
  It has been a privilege to work with them and the knowledge has helped me improve my technical skills, as well as affirm my passion to improve people's lives through technology.
  Currently, I am learning more  web programming technology and in the process of working on different web frameworks, such as ReactJS.
