      <p>I graduated from National University of Singapore (NUS) in computer science. Currently I am working at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Singapore.

        I am a person who is eager to learn. Till today, I have gained massive interest in both web development and development operations. In terms of web development, I am interested in ReactJS, RXjs, GraphQL, RelayJS, and many more In terms of development
        operations, I like the idea of containerisation platform. Yup, for this case I am talking about Docker and frens, which is Kubernetes (:
      </p>

      <p>
        As I am burning with lots of questions, I have been attending many meetups in Singapore which were arranged by meetup.com. I am part of Kubernetes User Group, Docker User Group, Talk JS User Group and many more. I hope that one day I can share some of
        my experiences as well.

      <p> Back in school, I have been exposed to various modules in android application, web development, games, animation, film, among others. I've taken two games development module in NUS where my team has to develop an android game within 9 weeks. We
        uploaded our android game to google play. Here is the link to my game project
